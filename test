% LaTeX template for the CANDIDATE ACTIVITY OUTLINE FORM.
%
% PTtemplate2022.tex = name of this file.
% See end of the file for its history.
%
% IMPORTANT: READ THE COMMENTS IN THIS FILE; THEY INCLUDE INSTRUCTIONS
% THAT *MUST* BE FOLLOWED WHEN PREPARING YOUR FILE FOR THE DEPARTMENT.
%
% FILE NAMING: each user of this template should customize the
% filename in a uniform manner, as follows: A candidate whose surname
% is "Smith" should name the file "PTsmith.tex".
%
% This template is for use by faculty in the UIUC Mathematics
% Department in the promotion process, including 3rd year letters, etc.
% For the eventual promotion evaluation, it is important that CV and
% publication list materials be presented in a consistent manner,
% following the specifications of the Provost's "Communication #9"
% rigorously.  In order to maintain consistency of presentation
% throughout the process, this template should be used at every stage.
%
%
% INSTRUCTIONS:
%
% Most things are self-explanatory.  The template takes care of
% formatting matters, so DO NOT use commands that affect spacing, font
% size, page size, etc.  Consult the PT committee chair if you need to
% deviate from any instructions.
%
% Refer to the Provost's "Communication #9" for additional
% instructions and guidelines. This template is derived from
% Communication #9, especially from the outline of a promotion
% document and the instructions for its use. It is important that you
% become familiar with Communication #9.  As that document is updated
% yearly, if anything in this template does not match the
% Communication #9, please bring this to the attention the PT chair.
%
% Note that all items in a given subsection need to be arranged in
% chronological (NOT reverse chronological) order.  In each
% subsection, pay close attention to the comments located there. These
% explain many small matters of detail which must be followed.
%
%
% NEW FOR 2022: There is no longer any interleaving between the parts
% of the PT packet written by the candidate and the department.  This
% document is for the candidate; there is a separate document for the
% UNIT EVALUATION FORM.

\section{II}{Publications and Creative Works}

% NOTE: In each subsection, list items in chronological order from
% past to present. Put a period at the end of each item.  Give dates
% with commas, as in "April, 2006."  In each subsection where
% publications are listed, the items should be numbered, so the

%
% IT IS *VERY IMPORTANT* THAT THE NUMBERING OF ITEMS BE KEPT THE SAME
% OVER TIME; DO NOT ALLOW THIS TO CHANGE FROM ONE USE OF THIS FILE TO
% THE NEXT.  EVALUATORS MAY REFER TO A PUBLICATION BY ITS NUMBER,
% WHICH LEADS TO HARMFUL CONFUSION IF THE NUMBERS CHANGE.
%
% Uniformity of presentation is important to the department when
% several dossiers are being sent up.  Keep the subsection headings

%              None.
%
% For each item, give the publication information in full.
% Authors should be listed *exactly* as in the item as published.
% Give the full name of the journal or other publisher (not an
% abbreviation), and give the publication details completely.  
%

% final form, it should not be described as "to appear" or
% "accepted", and it should not appear in section F. 

% Papers not yet accepted for publication may be listed in section M.
% Give the number of manuscript pages in the latest version.
% Describe the status of the item  completely and accurately. 
%
% Consult the department chair or the PT committee chair in case of
% doubt.
%
% In 2017, the Communication was revised to add (page 22):
%
%''For candidates for promotion to Full Professor, please indicate which
%publications and creative works occurred since the most recent
%promotion.''
%

% Keep the next lines intact.  Use the notations \# and $\ast\;$ and $+$ for
% each publication according to the definitions given in the next lines:

\bigskip
\noindent
\#\quad Denotes any publication derived from the candidate's thesis.

\noindent
$\ast\;$\quad Denotes publication that has undergone stringent editorial
review by peers.

\noindent
$+$\quad Denotes publication that was invited and carries special
prestige and recognition.

\noindent 
$F$\quad For promotion to Full Professor, denotes new publication
since last promotion at Illinois.
