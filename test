%
% This template is for use by faculty in the UIUC Mathematics
% Department in the promotion process, including 3rd year letters, etc.
% For the eventual promotion evaluation, it is important that CV and
% publication list materials be presented in a consistent manner,
% following the specifications of the Provost's "Communication #9"
% rigorously.  In order to maintain consistency of presentation
% throughout the process, this template should be used at every stage.
%
%
% INSTRUCTIONS:
%
% Most things are self-explanatory.  The template takes care of
% formatting matters, so DO NOT use commands that affect spacing,
% font size, page size, etc. Avoid the use of custom macros.  Consult
% the PT committee chair or department chair if you need to deviate
% from any instructions.
% Refer to the Provost's "Communication #9" for additional
% instructions and guidelines. This template is derived from
% communication #9, especially from the outline of a promotion
% document and the instructions for its use.
% It is important that you become familiar with communication #9.
% Note that all items in a given subsection need to be arranged in
% chronological (NOT reverse chronological) order.
% In each subsection, pay close attention to the comments located
% there. These explain many small matters of detail which must be
% followed.
